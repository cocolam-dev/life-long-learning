            Snow chasing near Sydney with your furry friend
        </h1>
        <p>
            It's not easy finding snow near Sydney, Australia, and a lot of the places that snow in Australia are within
            national parks and therefore dogs are not allowed.
        </p>
        <p>
            But with a bit of research, preparation and patience, it is possible for your beloved furry friend to
            experience snow less than 3 hours from Sydney.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Blue Mountains are famous for the three sisters, the jenolan caves, and the breathtaking canyon views,
            but for several times each year, it also snows in certain parts of the area that are on higher altitude.

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Research - find out when it's getting a big dump of snow - check <a
                    href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/2174804179300168/" class="link" target="_blank">Central
                    Tablelands Snow Sightings</a></li>
            <li>Prepare - get ready and have everything packed the night before.</li>
            <li>Explore - get there early, and drive around to find the best spots.</li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <h3>Have realistic expectation</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Don't expect to find thick powdery snow everywhere; you may need to drive around to find it. Treat it as
                an adventure.</li>
            <li>Don't expect 5-star facilities.</li>
            <li>The snow won't stay around for long; it may start melting when the sun comes out.</li>
        </ul>
        <br />

        <div class="divider"></div>
        <h2>Research</h2>
        <p>
            As the snow on the Blue Mountains often arrive with little notice, the best way to find out when it's about
            to snow, or when it's snowing, is through the locals. Around winter time (between June and August, but it
            could be as early as May), monitor the below:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                There is a Facebook group called <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/2174804179300168/"
                    class="external link" target="_blank">Central Tablelands Snow Sightings</a>, where locals generously
                share
                updates on snow sightings around the Central Tablelands / Blue Mountains area. I find it an excellent
                resource for snow sighting updates in the area.
            </li>
            <li>
                There is a live <a href="https://oberonst.liveweatherviews.com/" class="link" target="_blank">webcam</a>
                in the heart of Oberon, however there're several shortcomings with using
                it to track snow and so should not be relied upon on its own. For example, it's not a good
                representation of the condition of the whole area. Also, I don't think it is a 24 hour webcam; it does
                not run overnight.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <div class="divider"></div>
        <h2>Prepare</h2>
        <p>
            Sometimes you won't know if it's worth driving to the Blue Mountains to chase the snow until the night
            before. It's an adventure that needs to be done 'on an impulse', which adds to the fun and excitement!
        </p>
        <p>
            You could drive to the Blue Mountains the day before and stay overnight, but one problem is that if you're
            taking your furry friend with you, it may be difficult to find pet-friendly accommodation on short notice.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another option would be to drive to the Blue Mountains as a day trip. It would be best to get there as early
            as possible, because when the sun comes out, the snow will start melting. When we went in mid-May 2023, by
            noon most of the snow exposed to sunlight were melted. Although there were still plenty of snow deep in the
            state forests under the shades of the tall pine trees, it definitely lacks the magical winter wonderland
            atmosphere. Having things ready the night before would help with getting out the door faster the next
            morning.
        </p>
        <p>Besides the advantage of leaving home as early as you can (we left home at 4.15am, arriving in Oberon at
            around 6.30am), you may also spend the majority of time driving around the state forests, with little to no
            facilities nearby. If you are well prepared for the adventure, you'll be able to maximise the time spent
            exploring the area:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Clothing - make sure to wear/bring enough to stay warm: base layers, beanie, gloves, extra jacket, thick
                socks, extra socks in case they get wet from the snow, etc.
            </li>
            <li>Food and drinks - bring breakfast, snacks, and hot drinks in thermos such as tea
                or coffee, and of course plenty of water, enough for both yourself and your dog. The hot drinks are
                important, not only to keep you hydrated but also to warm you up. Having enough food to keep you full
                will also save you time from having to drive back into town in the middle of your adventure just for a
                bite.
            </li>
            <li>
                Towel - mainly for your furry friend, as they may be wet from running or playing in the snow
            </li>
            <li>Toilet - there's no toilet in the state forests, so have a quick stopover at the Oberon town centre
                before you start the snow chasing adventure in state forests. There's one near the Oberon visitor
                information centre (12 Cook St, Oberon).
            </li>
            <li>
                Fuel - top up the car fuel the day before, to save you time from having to refuel on the way there.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Adventure</h2>
        <p>
            The <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/2174804179300168/" class="link" target="_blank">Central
                Tablelands Snow Sightings</a> Facebook group would probably have given you some ideas of
            where to find the snow, however you may still need to drive around to find the best spots, as it's a large
            area.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are several state forests in the area, and each one may have several entrances or road through it.
            During our trip, we checked out Essington State Forest and Vulcan State Forest, and found Vulcan State
            Forest to be the magical wonderland. It will of course be different every time depending on where the snow
            is
            dumped the night before.
        </p>
        <p>
            We drove around the forest, looking into each entrance as we drove pass (the passenger of course, not the
            driver) and checking out a few that looks promising. That's when we stumbled across the Boggy Swamp Road,
            featured in the photo at the top of this page.

        <h2>Other Tips</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Note that certain sections of the drive may be on unsealed road.
            </li>
            <li>
                There might be mushrooms in the state forests and some may be poisonous. Keep a close eye on your furry
                friend to make sure they don't snack on them.
            </li>
            <li>
                When you've had enough of the snow, you could also check out some of the lookouts around Katoomba for
                some breathtaking canyon views. We went to the Cahill's lookout, which allows dogs.
            </li>
            <li>Katoomba is about 1.5 hours from Oberon and has plenty of cafes and restaurants to choose from.</li>
        </ul>
