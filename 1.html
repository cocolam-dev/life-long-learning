        </h1>

        <!-- <h2>
        Before
    </h2> -->
        <p>
            I woke up one day, suddenly having no strength to lift my arms above my head.
        </p>

        <!-- <p>
        It was strange, but I didn't give it much thought and decided I would just rest for a day or two.
        Maybe I had pulled a muscle or something.
    </p>

    <p>
        A day later, I started developing shortness of breath.
    </p> -->

        <p>
            Five days later, I was in Intensive Care Unit (ICU), relying on a BiPAP ventilator to help me breathe.
        </p>

        <p>
            The muscle weakness disease is called Myasthenia Gravis (MG). It is an autoimmune disease where
            the body creates antibodies that attack the neuromuscular junctions, leading to muscle weakness
            in various parts of the body.
        </p>

        <!-- <p>
        For some, it's mostly a droopy eyelid. For me, I launched straight into a crisis.
        The first two days in ICU, I was too weak to sit up on my own or lift my hands high enough
        to touch my ears. I hated the BiPAP but it was a truly life-saving invention, without which I
        would have to be intubated.
    </p>

    <p>
        I was discharged from the hospital two weeks later, only to return in less than a week, this time with
        swallowing issue. Food was constantly stuck in the middle of the esophagus, I started choking
        on water and was really scared everytime I had to take my medication.
    </p> -->

        <p>
            For months after I was discharged from the hospital, many of the day to day tasks were a struggle.
            Getting dressed was not easy -- I was too weak to lift my arms up high, and my neck was too weak to keep
            my head in place if I bend forward even just slightly. Pouring water from a jug or lifting a plate of food
            into the microwave - things I never thought of as difficult in the past - became taxing. I would get
            tired quickly, huffing and puffing just from taking a short, gentle stroll. For a few months, chewing food
            was exhausting, and my speech would slur easily.
        </p>

        <div class="divider"></div>

        <h2>
            Now
        </h2>

        <p>
            I now exercise 5-7 days a week, doing a mix of cardio and strength training workouts.

        </p>

        <p>
            Sometimes I would go for a jog 30 minutes or longer -- something i have never, ever, been able to do in my
            life
            before.
            I have tried jogging before, but I was never able to get past one and a half minutes before needing to rest.
        </p>

        <div class="divider"></div>

        <h2>
            How I got to where I am now
        </h2>

        <p>
            Having a good doctor and receiving adequate treatment are of course paramount.
            But they would at most restore me back to where I was; they don't make me healthier
            and stronger.
        </p>

        <p>
            When my strength slowly returned with treatment, I started exercising. I started small, such as walking
            around inside the house, or doing a few basic squats. I just did whatever was enough to make me feel a bit
            tired
            but not overly so.
            When I felt strong enough I started jogging, first doing just one-minute intervals, then slowly increase
            from there.
        </p>

        <p>
            I wanted to be able to jog for 30 minutes without rest, but I really could not see how it would be
            possible, seeing how I would get completely exhausted just from a one-minute jog!
            But I kept at it anyway. I told myself if I end up never achieving it, it's still ok,
            it's still counted as exercise which is good for my health anyway. My goal was less about achieving
            a certain distance or speed or time, but just to keep exercising / jogging regularly.
        </p>

        <p>
            It blows my mind how much we can achieve with just tiny steps but done consistently. It's so true when they
            say
            people tend to overestiamte how much they can achieve in one day, and underestimate how much they can
            achieve in
            one year
            (in my case a few months).
            I think a few things have helped me:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>my neurologist told me the benefit of exercise in combating many of the side effects of steroid, which I
                was
                and am still taking as at the time of writing</li>
            <li>knowing first hand what it's like to be sick and weak and dependent on others, I wanted to do something
                for
                my own health</li>
            <li>I started small, and kept the increments small also, adding just one more minute of jogging, or one more
                rep
                of squat each time I'm ready for the next step</li>
            <li>I tell myself exrcising is non-negotiable. It is my daily top priority, and I try to get it done first
                thing
                in the morning</li>
            <li>I identify myself as someone who exercises consistently. I promise myself I will continue to exericse
                for
                the rest of my life</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="divider"></div>

        <h2>Try this</h2>
        <p>Try the below to see if they help you in moving towards your goals, even if it means making one tiny change
            at a
            time:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>List the benefits of achieving your goal</li>
            <li>List the downsides of not achieving your goal. Vividly imagine the pain from them whenever you want to
                skip a day or give up</li>
            <li>Break down what you need to do into small steps, and keep the increments small</li>
            <li>Make it a non-negotiable, daily top priority, and try to get it done earlier during the day so that
                you don't get distracted by other tasks or too tired to start</li>
            <li>Identify yourself as someone who does what you want to do consistently. For example, instead of
                saying "I'm trying to exercise", say "I exercise everyday". Or, instead of "I'm trying to eat healthy",
                say
                "I only
                eat healthy food", or "I don't eat junk"
            </li>

        </ul>
