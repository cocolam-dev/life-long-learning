            4. The Ying and Yang of Pleasure and Pain
        </h1>
        <p>
            It's innate in every one of us to pursue pleasure and avoid pain. But sometimes things are more complicated
            than they appear. Pleasure and pain don't always happen in silo, in fact they often go hand in hand.
        </p>
        <p>So what if a pleasure comes with pain, is it still worth pursuing? And what if that
            pleasure is in the future and requires us to put up with pain in the present? Since we don't know what's
            going to happen tomorrow, no one knows for sure when he or she will die, wouldn't it make more sense to
            trade the future pleasure for present pleasure?
        </p>
        <div class="divider"></div>

        <p>
            At one point I pondered on the argument that if no one knows what's going to happen in the future, nothing
            can be guaranteed in the future, none of us can be sure if we woudld still be alive tomorrow, let alone 10,
            20, or 30 years later, then if we have to choose between something that brings instant pleasure but may
            cause pain later, versus something that causes pain now but may bring pleasure in a very distant future,
            then it makes a lot more sense to pick the present pleasure. The present pain or pleasure is guaranteed,
            but the future ones are not; moreover, we may never live to experience the future ones anyway.
        </p>
        <p>
            What's the point of living if we deprive ourselves of pleasure, and instead make ourselves go through
            pain everyday? It sounds absurd!
        </p>
        <p>
            Should we indulge in something we love everyday, such as eating ice cream and fried chicken and watching
            TV from the couch for hours, even though they may lead to poor health in a few decades when we're old?
        </p>
        <p>
            Or, should we torture ourselves by forcing ourselves to get up earlier every morning to exercise, straining
            and sweating for half an hour and looking like a snow monkey in a Japanese onsen with a bright red face,
            then make ourselves learn or read something new so we look dumb most of the time, in the hope that it may
            bring us better health as we age and brighter future with the extra skill or knowledge?
        </p>
        <p>
            The problem is that there's no guarantee that those torture we subject ourselves to today will definitely
            lead to a better future. I may suddenly catch a strange disease that cripples my health regardless of how
            much exercise I've done and how much bad food I've avoided. Similarly, we have heard plenty of stories of
            people who had the worst lifestyle yet live to a ripe old age free of diseases. And wouldn't life be
            so sad if we deny ourselves the freedom to choose what we enjoy now? Is a life without the freedom to enjoy
            it still a life worthwhile?
        </p>

        <h3>Is it really a choice made out of free will?</h3>
        <p>
            One day, I came across something in a book called Tools of Titans by Tim Ferriss, which gave me a smack in
            the
            head.
            Jocko Willink, a retired U.S. Navy SEAL, said, </p>
        <p class="quote">
            discipline equals freedom.
        </p>
        <p>'If we give in to spontaneous
            distractions and abandon our goals easily, this is not true freedom, this is just doing things that others
            try to get us to do (watch their videos, buy their stuff, so they earn money from you)... Being disciplined
            gives you the freedom to do what you want to do, instead of wasting your time on random things'.
        </p>
        <p>
            Eating bad food, watching random videos, just overall the pursuit of instant gratification, all these are
            probably driven by our reptilian brain that primarily focuses on survival. Our brain did not have enough
            time to evolve to adapt to the modern world, where food is in abundance, and modern inventions have almost
            eliminated all the needs to move our body (we don't even need to get up from the couch to turn on the TV
            now, Alexa will take care of that for you).
        </p>
        <p>
            But I'm sure most of us crave more than just survival. There are two of me inside my head, the reptilian me
            who wants to stuff my face with all the high energy food I can get my hands on, and the executive me,
            living in my prefrontal cortex, who tries to persuade me to eat healthy, exercise, and learn new things.
            Which 'me' do I identify more with? If I identify myself as someone who strive to improve and seeks
            wisdom in life, someone who can plan ahead, overcome hurdles and remain disciplined in order to achieve
            my goals, then, giving in to my reptilian urge to eat another donut is not a choice I choose
            out of true free will, but an unconscious decision I make under my own reptilian spell.
        </p>
        <p>
            Before we identify a decision we make as a freedom of choice, stop to consider whether it really is 
            what you would have chosen? Does it match with what you really want in life?
        </p>
        <div class="divider"></div>
        <h3>If it's not guaranteed, why bother?</h3>
        <p>
            The other problem is, even if we know that we want to live a healthy life by eating healthy and exercising,
            there is no guarantee that our healthy choices today are going to lead to good health in our future. We may
            not even be around to enjoy it by then. So why bother? Why not take a chance and just enjoy pleasure in the
            present instead (ice cream for breakfast)?
        </p>
        <p>
            Although there is no guarantee that I'll live to an old age, there is also a fair bit of chance that I will.
            And if I really make it to an old age, I definitely want to have a healthy body that will allow me to do
            most of the things that I want to do, instead of being frail and dependent on others, unable to go anywhere
            and enjoy life, just sitting inside an aged care home waiting to be fed and cleaned. In other words, the pain 
            from being frail and dependent is so strong to me that I would do all I can to avoid it.
        </p>
        <p>
            There is also no guarantee that my healthy choices today will give me good health in old age. I may have
            bad genes or be involved in some tragic accidents. But the last thing I want is to get to old age with poor
            health due to my bad habits over the decades, and wish I had made healthier choices when I was younger.
            I want to be able to say that I have tried my best to preserve my health, and whatever else happen
            is outside of my control. I have no regrets.
        </p>

        <h3>True freedom comes from what we really want in life</h3>
        <p>
            As Jocko Willink pointed out, it is displine that will give us true freedom. If we want to get out of 
            debt and be financially independent, so that we can have the freedom to live a more comfortable life, it is 
            discipline that will get us there, not the so-called freedom to splurge on another expensive handbag 
            we saw on the celebrities. If we want to be in better health and shape so that we can have the 
            freedom to travel and walk around all day in a foreign country, it is discipline that can get us there, 
            not the so-called freedom to eat greasy food everyday.
