            3. If at first you don't succeed, try, try again
        </h1>
        <p>
            If there is something that we want to learn, but we're unable to find any good resource on the subject, does
            that mean we have no chance of learning that subject?
        </p>
        <p>
            If we try to learn something but keeps failing, or we don't see much progress, does that indicate we lack
            the 'talent' and should just give up?
        </p>

        <p>
            Besides learning to juggle (which I mentioned in the <a href="2.html" class="link" target="_blank">previous article</a>),
            another thing I wanted to learn was
            whistling. I had made a few futile attempts at learning it in the past but
            each time got discouraged quickly.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once at a regular specialist appointment for my Myasthenia Gravis (an autoimmune disease as mentioned in <a
                href="1.html" class="link" target="_blank">this article</a>), while assessing my weakenss the neurologist asked if I
            could whistle. That gave me a desire to learn it once and for all because then it could be used as a
            potential assessment to see if my weakness might be going downhill (I'm a little obsessed at assessing my
            weaknesses and keeping records).
        </p>

        <p>
            So I watched a few youtube videos on how to whistle, none of which I found to be particularly helpful,
            because I was having a lot of difficulty grasping and following the instructions on all the fine movements
            and precise positions of the tongue and lips and everything else.
        </p>
        <p>
            At the time I was a little obsessed with listening to Andrew Huberman's podcast. Andrew Huberman is (at the
            time of writing) a neurobiology professor at Stanford School of Medicine. In the video at the bottom of this
            article (which is set to start at 39:29), Prof Huberman explained that what helps us learn is many repeated
            attempts where we make mistakes, and trying to correct those mistakes. Interestingly, there does not need to
            be clear guidance on what needs to be done to correct each mistake, just that we need to know we've made a
            mistake and we attempt to correct it.
        </p>
        <p>
            It's what makes learning to whistle so frustrating: no matter how hard I try, no sound would come out, yet
            no one can show me exactly what intricate adjustments I need to make to all the different muscles in my
            mouth and lips.
        </p>
        <p>
            Many of us were brought up to expect answers to be given to us by the adults or at the back of the exercise
            book. We may make a few attempts but would quickly refer to the answer given and try to work backward from
            it. So when we come across something that doesn't come with the model answer, we give up easily.
        </p>
        <p>
            I decided I would commit a few minutes every day to attempt at learning to whistle. For a long time I
            produced no sound at all, but I had no idea what I did wrong and what adjustments I should make. I kept at
            it anyway, playing around with different adjustments and trying very hard not to give up (lack of progress
            is a big factor leading to giving up).
        </p>
        <p>
            Then one day, magically, a faint sound came out. It was weak and wasn't a very nice tone, still I was
            overjoyed! But then it disappeared as suddenly as it appeared. I couldn't reproduce it for a while, but it
            eventually came back again. Over time slowly I could start to reproduce it more and more often.
        </p>
        <p>
            At that point, I could only produce that one tone. But again, I kept at it, not knowing what I was doing,
            and then just like magic, I started producing a few more tones. I can now sort of whistle an octave, though
            often I struggle with the higher tones. But I won't give up because I know that I just need to keep at it
            and one day it will click.
        </p>
        <div class="divider"></div>
        <p>
            The whole process of learning to whistle has opened my eyes to the amazing human learning ability. It
            doesn't matter if we don't have access to the best coach and clearest step-by-step
            instructions. We can learn something simply by repeatedly trying to do it, over and over again, adjusting
            ourselves to correct our mistakes as we go, until we succeed.
        </p>
        <p>
            This of course may not apply to everything we want to learn. With more complicated learnings, guidance and
            feedback are essential and may speed up our learning. But
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>we should not be deterred from learning just by a lack of access to the best resources</li>
            <li>we should view mistakes as an essential part in the learning process</li>
            <li>Progress does not always happen in a linear fashion. Don't give up just because you don't see much
                progress, especially in the early stages</li>
            <li>Commit to it, even just a little bit, everyday, and let your brain works its magic unconsciously</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            If at first you don't succeed, try, try again.
