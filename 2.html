        2. Just a few minutes a day to learn a new skill
    </h1>

    <p>
        There may be something that you've always wanted to learn.
        The piano, the guitar, a foreign language, chess, swimming, etc.
    </p>

    <p>
        But where do I start? I don't have the time to learn a new skill! How can I spare an extra hour each day to
        learn it?
        I'm busy enough just surviving! Going to work, cooking, cleaning, etc. They take up all the time I have already!
    </p>

    <p>
        But what if learning is easier than we thought? What if picking up a new skill can be done with less daily
        commitment than we thought?
    </p>

        There are quite a few 'weird' things that I wanted to learn, among them, learning to juggle. When I first
        attempted to juggle,
        it was disheartening. My total lack of hand-eye coordination is jaw-dropping.
    </p>

    <p>
        So I started small. I started with just juggling one ball. Yes, ONE! It's embarrassing to admit!
        And I only practised about 10 to 15 minutes a day. I watched a youtube video with a few tips, then I just
        started at it.
        I didn't spend hours researching on the best technique or reading up on all the books out there on juggling.
        All I did was started very small -- throwing one ball from one hand to the other.
    </p>

    <p>
        Then I added a second ball. And then I added a third ball. I am far from being able to impress someone with my
        juggling skill,
        but at least I can manage three balls at the same time for a little while, which a few months prior was
        completely impossible for me.
    </p>

    <p>
        The progress may be slow, but the commitment isn't that big, just 10-15 minutes a day.
        I was making a lot of mistakes, throwing the balls all over the place, but I just kept at it. And slowly it
        started to click.
    </p>

    <div class="divider"></div>

    <p>
        Yes, learning to juggle may be relatively easy compared to some of the other skills. But if we keep our
        expectation reasonable,
        there aren't many things that can't be learned through small steps.
    </p>

    <p>
        Take language for example. I attempted at learning French without committing a full-time schedule to it.
        I listen to simple, slow, clearly spoken French daily, not a huge amount of time, and slowly, very slowly,
        I started to be able to understand some very simple conversations, compared to the beginning when I could not
        understand a single thing.
        While I'm still not able to understand the more complicated or faster dialogues or hold a conversation in
        French,
        I have a much better comprehension of the language compared to when I first started. I kept my expectation
        reasonable:
        I wasn't expecting to be able to speak the language fluently in 3 months. But to get to where I am with just a
        few minutes of practice
        each day, I find it totally mind-blowing.

        We often overestimate how much we can do in a day, and underestimate how much we can do in a year.
    </p>

    <p>
        You may ask, but if I can't do something well (speak fluent French, play the hardest Chopin piece on the piano,
        etc.),
        what's the point of learning in the first place?
    </p>

    <p>
        Of course it would be great if we could throw ourselves into the deep end and not have to worry about anything
        else,
        but often the various other life commitments prevent us from doing so.
        Learning something is better than learning nothing at all. At the very least it's probably good insurance
        against cognitive decline as we age.
        If there is something that you want to learn, but you think you can't commit to it, think again.
    </p>

    <p class="quote">
        Learning doesn't always have to be a full-time commitment. It doesn't have to be all or nothing.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you want to learn French, imagine if you learn a phrase everyday. By the end of a year, you'll know 365
        French phrases!
        If you can't manage one phrase a day, make it one a week, you'll still be able to say 52 French phrases! That's
        still much better than
        getting deterred by it and not learning a single French word.
    </p>

    <p>
        Pick something you want to learn, and just start today. You don't need a perfect plan before starting.
        The most important thing is that you actually make a start. Equally important though is that you commit to it.
        Commit just 10 minutes a day, or even five, whatever you can manage. Progress may be slow, but keep at it.
        In a few months time, you'll look back and be amazed at how far you've come.
